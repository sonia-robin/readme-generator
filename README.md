# README Generator App

## Description
The README Generator App is a command-line tool designed to simplify the process of creating a comprehensive README file for your projects. With just a few prompts, this app generates a well-structured README with essential sections, such as project description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and more.
It also generates a Table of Contents with links for quick navigation.

## Installation
Use 'npn install' or 'npm i' to install dependencies.

## Usage

You will be prompted with questions to provide your project details.

After answering all questions, a README.md file will be generated.
